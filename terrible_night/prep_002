# Encounter with Guardian

We were once ordinary followers of Raat Maana, dedicated to preserving the
delicate harmony of night and day.
But when the balance was shattered, we took an oath—a sacred pact with our deity.
Through an ancient ritual, we became one with the jungle,
transformed into guardians of the Moon Relic.
Our bodies changed, our spirits bound to this sacred duty.
For centuries, we have protected the relic and maintained the balance.
But now, the earth grows violent, and the relic is ensnared.
We can no longer fulfill our duty alone.

(players respond?)

You must venture into the Temple of the Ensnared Moon and retrieve the relic.
Only with its power restored can the balance be mended and the chaos quelled.

They give them glowing stones.

The Temple of the Ensnared Moon is an ancient structure now overrun
by aggressive, sentient vegetation.

with the scent of damp earth and the sound of rustling leaves.

## dialog with guardians

Eldarion:

You have done well, brave travelers.
By retrieving the sacred moon relic, you have taken the first crucial step toward
restoring the balance that was lost.
Raat Maana's blessing shines upon you both.

Eldarion extends a hand, revealing two items that seem to shimmer with an ethereal light.

As a token of our gratitude, we bestow upon you these gifts.
Carl, the Ensnaring Bracers.
Felix, Gaea’s Pendant.
Both crafted from the very vines of the temple.

But your journey is far from over.
To truly restore balance, you must now seek a follower of Din Pita
who desires the same harmony as you.
We will continue to guard the Moon relic,
and when the time is right, we will be there to aide you.

Should you ever need our guidance or wish to return, speak to the trees.
They are our silent watchers, and they will respond.
They will illuminate a glowing path, leading you back to us.

May the light of Raat Maana guide you.
