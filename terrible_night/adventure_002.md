# Sesson 2 - Temple of the Ensnared Moon

## The hook

Guardians explain:

> We were once ordinary followers of Raat Maana, dedicated to preserving the
> delicate harmony of night and day.
> But when the balance was shattered, we took an oathâ€”a sacred pact with our deity.
> Through an ancient ritual, we became one with the jungle,
> transformed into guardians of the Moon Relic.
> Our bodies changed, our spirits bound to this sacred duty.
> For centuries, we have protected the relic and maintained the balance.
> But now, the earth grows violent, and the relic is ensnared.
> We can no longer fulfill our duty alone.

## The dungeon crawl

Then they ask the heroes to get the Moon Relic, which they do.

The temple is all made of vines, and starts by a long tunnel.
They encounter attacking vines and snakes.
Felix uses bear powers.

Then they come to a big opening, filled with water to their knees.
Felix turns into a crocodile, they wade through together,
beating more snakes.

Another tunnel, fighting more attacking vines, flying fanged frogs,
snakes, and a tunnel with vines covered in purple ungulating
bulbs that burst and give off poison.

Then they come to a big opening, also filled with water to their knees,
except or vines comnig up in the middle holding the moon relic.
Room is guarded by an giant centipede.
They get the relic, and head back out.

The way back out is mostly easy, except at the very end
lots of vines and flying fanged frogs  come out them trying to
prevent them from exiting.
The heroes are quite beat up at the end.

## The outro

The guardians express deep gratitude.
They extract vines from the temple and create a magic item for each:

* Felix gets the Groveheart Amulet
* Carl gets the Vinewoven Bracers

We have not said what they do yet,
I told them they could help decide what they do.

The guardians then explained that they needed to find the Sun Relic,
and recover the lost ritual that combines the Sun and Moon Relics
which will restore balance.
The guardians will keep the Moon Relic, but are willing to help when needed.
