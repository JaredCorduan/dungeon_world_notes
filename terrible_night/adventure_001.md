Ther are two players characters:

* Felix the elf druid
* Carl the dwarf fighter.

Being a druid, Felix cares about nature being in balance.
He heard rumors about a schism within the priesthood of the Ancient Ones,
where the followers of the Sun god, named Din Pita,
exiled the followers of the Moon god, Raat Maana.
It is rumored that the followers of Raat Maana traveled deep into the forest
to never be seen again.
Felix wanted to investigate, and see how to bring balance back.
He heard rumors of Carl's bravery, and asked him to accompany him, which he accepted.

They started out in the Jungle village called Jangalog.
There they met the priestess Aruna, who told them to find a guide into the deep forest.
In the tavern, they met Gan Kapu, a local who offered to help.

On the way, they were attacked by vampire frogs.
Both Felix and Carl were badly hurt, Carl missing a lot, and Gan Kapu died.
The Felix and Carl were now lost in the Jungle.

They made camp. In the morning, they saw a glowing path.
Felix morphed into an eagle and flew up high to see where Jangalog was,
and where the path led.
They saw that the path lead deeper into a very dense part of the Jungle.
They decided to take the path deeper.

They camp to what looked like the remains of an old crumbled city wall.
Felix noticed a strange tall wooden statue that looked a bit like a tree.
While searching the wall, Carl fell into quicksand.
Felix helped him out, but in the commotion, they were attacked by a giant mosquito-like large monster.
Before being defeated, it managed to sting them with its proboscis. Both became sick.

Felix search for an antidote, which he found.
Then they prepared a potion from the herbs, boiling water with a fire.
Then the wooden statue came to life and asked them "What are you doing here?".
