# Sesson 2 - Prison Break 

## background exploration

### Elves

Elves are common in some parts of the world.
Like forests. They live in big trees.
Felix left to explore.

### Dwarves

Dwarves are common in some parts of the world.
Like underground, and hidden away.

### Other

It is still unclear what Felix's magical pendant does.
Maybe communicate with Carl when in animal form?
Maybe manipulate the earth?

## The hook

The adventurers find Aruna and she tells them that she
is sympathetic to the revival of Raat Maana.
She tells them that Liora tried to get information about
the Sun Relic in Sunhaven, but has gone silent.
She tells them to find Varen, a guard in Sunhaven
that is also sympathetic.

They can identifiy Varen by the scar on his right arm.

## The adventure

Felix wants to learn how to make a glider
(so that he can become one himself),
and searches Jangalog for someone who can help.
The find **Kavi the engineer**, who is making a windmill
out of ropes and wood.
He says he would love to help, but doesn't know how,
and suggests they search the library in Sunhaven.

The adventures travel to Sunhaven.

In the library, Felix turns into an owl and searches
for glider tech, but finds nothing.
Carl finds a small mention of an inventer **Stuart**
who supposedly had plans for a glider.

The adventurers find Varen and plan an escape for Liora.
The plan is for Felix to turn into a mouse, and Varen
to prentend to be taken a prisoner (Carl) into the dungeon.
Felix is in Carl's pocket, and studies the keys on the
guards' belt.
Note that Carl has no weapon or armor.

Varen goes near Liora's cell, and Felix crawls out of Carl's
pocket and stays there, while Varen takes Carl to a cell,
him up, and leaves (waiting outside for them).
Felix tells Liora his plan, and turns into a key, which Liora
uses to free herself and the other prisoners around her.

One prisoner was a **sneaky halfling** who should totally
come back later to thank them.

Liora then travels to Carl's cell, and see a Lizard man.
She throws the key/Felix into Carl's cell.
Carl frees himself and lunges after the Lizardman.
Carl then distracts the Lizardman (and protects Liora)
while Felix frees more prisoners.

The adventurers successfully use the chaos to esape back out.
Carls smashes one of the guards at the exit, and the other
flees.

Varen leads them into a back alley, and to his house.
The guards rush out of the prison and shout about the
prison break.

## New plot

* Kavi the engineer, who might help them make a glider,
  lives in Jangalog.
* Stuart, unknown person who maybe made a glider.
* Prisoners who escaped along with Liora.
