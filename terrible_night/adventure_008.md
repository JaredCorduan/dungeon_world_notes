# The Radiant Bastion

Aruna told the heroes that her spies informed her
that something big was going on at the Radiant Bastion.
They assumed (rightly) that Thaldrin was about to
perform the ritual to turn himself into a dragon.

The rode (Felix as a horse, Carl as a rider) to the Radiant Bastion.
As they drew near, they saw many Lizardmen constructing a huge
wooden platform and a small tower like construct.

Felix tried to turn into a wasp to spy on them, but ended up as a wasp larva.
Carl flung Felix-the-larva into the shirt pocket of one of the work crew
groups that were eating lunch off the road.
There they learned that Thaldrin was planning his ritual for 24 hours, noon the next day.

Felix then tried to turn into a rolly-polly, but ended up as a huge (beach ball size)
rolly-polly. Carl carried him, walked up to the castle gates, and looked menacingly
at the guards. When asked what he was up to, he said "here with this for the ritual".
They let him through the main Castle walls.

They then entered tho castle itself. Went down a hall, then down stairs to the basement.
There they found a kitchen/cellar, and a head person barking orders around.
This head guy asked them what they were doing, they said they were there for the ritual.
He put them to work, carrying barrels out to the platform outside.
After a bit of that, back in the cellar, Felix turning into a flying ant and looking around.
He noticed one closet that had a suspiciously large lock on it.
He crawled through the door, and saw normal food stores, but also a huge chest.
with a huge lock on it. He used his groveheart amulet to split open the chest.

Out burst a large floating eyeball. it shot a light-beam at the closet wall, which burst open.
Carl, in the cellar, hit the eyeball with his sword, wounding it badly.
But it got away, soaring down the hallway, and blowing open the castle wall.
In the mean time, all the folks in the cellar went to alert Thaldrin.

As it went through the hole in the wall, two lizardmen threw a metal net over it.
Then Thadrin appear and shriek in anger at everything going wrong.
Then the eyeball died. Then Thaldrin decided to have the ritual with the newly dead eyeball,
phoenix feather, and sun relic.

Felix turned into a phoenix, flew to the roof, and used the groveheart amulet
to scatter the wood on the outside platform and crash the tower.
Carl, in his black hood, followed Thaldrin and his men to the wooden platform.
The lizardmen set fire to the fallen wooden tower, as Thaldrin started chanting.
Carl walked up, and sliced Thaldrin in half.
Felix, as a phoenix still, flew and rescued Carl, then went back to grab the sun relic.
They went back to Jangalog as heroes.
