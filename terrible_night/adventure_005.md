# Sesson 5 - Mountain pass to Oros

The adventurers wake up in Tavvy Tavern to Liora knocknig on their
door and telling them that there are wanted posters of them in town.

Liora also tells the adventurers that Thaldrin is after a phoenix feather
to complete a (unknown) ritual.
And that phoenixes are known to live in the mountains around the
mountain town of Oros (which is also where Kavi's uncle Stuart lives).

They sneak out of town, Carl in a black cloak and Felix turned into a horse.
They ride to the mountains.

Searchig the mountains, they encounters many fire beetles and one crystal spider.
Felix studies the fire beetles and can turn into them now.

They also spot lizardmen, servants of Thaldrin looking for a phoenix feather.
They successfully sneak past them and make it to a phoenix nest.
Felix, as a fire beetle, talks to the phoenix and warns them of Thaldrins plans,
which it is thankful to learn about.

They then make it to a tavern in Oros.
