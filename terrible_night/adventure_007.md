# Moonspire Castle

The heroes set off in search of Moonspire Castle.
As they serached the woods, a fog gathered.
It trickid them with voices, to separating them, and a fungal shambler
(undead deer with mushrooms growing on it) attacked them.
The mushroom monsters attacked them.

They find the castle. The halls are lined with (still) gargoyles.
They fight off a group of three fungal beserkers.
They find a library, and obtain a book all about moon and sun rune rituals.
They find a armory, where a glowing spear and three arrows float.
As they get near them, the gargoyles' eyes start to glow.
They leave them be for the time being.

They spend the night in the castle courtyard to recover.
They then find the dining hall and fight the Mushroom Matron.

They go back to the armory.
Felix uses his groveheart amulet to make a hole in the wall,
then he morphs into a horse and walks outside.
Carl grabs the arrows and spears, and runs through the hole, jumping on Felix's back.
Four gargoyles chase them out.
Carl uses his vinewoven bracers to trap three of the gargoyles.
Felix uses his groveheart amulet to bend the trees to stop the last gargoyle.
The last gargoyle stops at the edge of the forest and turns back to stone.


The heroes go back to Jangalog and talk to Aruna and Liora.
They learn that the rune book has both a ritual to return balance,
but also a ritual to use the sun rune to turn someone into a dragon.
They also learn that the moon arrows and spear are magical and can damage such
a dragon.
